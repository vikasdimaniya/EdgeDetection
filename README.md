Change the value of variable "d" to change the senstivity to color difference.

This project is based on color distance, very similar to document distancing yet very different.
 Here insted of finding difference between two documents we have two colors and insted of words we have RGB values.
 If the value of distance get past a certain value "d" in the program two colors are considered as very diffrent and
 an edge should be present between them. The metod is not very accurate but is fast and works really fine with images
 with less contrast or animated cartoons.
